## App Store Description

### Short Description (80 chars)
Track your diabetic pet's insulin, feeding, weight & vet info — all in one app.

### Full Description

**PawCare** is the all-in-one companion app for pet owners managing feline or canine diabetes. Whether your cat or dog needs insulin twice a day, PawCare helps you stay on top of every dose, every meal, and every weigh-in — so your furry family member stays healthy and happy.

**🐾 Everything You Need in One Place**

Managing a diabetic pet can feel overwhelming — but it doesn't have to be. PawCare gives you a beautiful, intuitive dashboard for each pet, with at-a-glance status on their last insulin dose, most recent feeding, current weight trend, and a countdown timer to their next injection.

**💉 Insulin Tracking**
Log every shot with dose, injection site, time, and notes. Use Quick Log to record a dose at your prescribed amount with a single tap. PawCare supports all common veterinary insulin types including Vetsulin, ProZinc, NPH (Humulin N), and Glargine (Lantus), in both U-40 and U-100 concentrations.

**🍽️ Feeding Log**
Track what your pet eats, how much, and when. Log wet food, dry food, and treats with customizable amounts and units. Consistent feeding is critical for diabetic pets — PawCare helps you stay on schedule.

**⚖️ Weight Monitoring**
Regular weigh-ins help you and your vet assess treatment effectiveness. PawCare charts your pet's weight trend over time with a beautiful interactive graph, making it easy to spot changes.

**⏰ Smart Reminders**
Set up recurring schedules for insulin injections, meals, and vet visits. Get push notifications so you never miss a dose — even during a busy day.

**🏥 Vet Info at Your Fingertips**
Store your veterinarian's contact details, emergency number, and clinic address right in the app. One-tap calling for both regular and emergency lines. Plus, built-in pro tips on injection technique, hypoglycemia signs, feeding timing, and insulin storage.

**👨‍👩‍👧 Share with Family & Pet Sitters**
Generate a simple 6-character share code and hand it to a family member, partner, or pet sitter. They can import your pet's profile and log entries too — everyone stays in sync.

**🎨 Beautiful & Customizable**
Choose from 5 gorgeous color themes (Warm, Ocean, Forest, Berry, Midnight), with full light and dark mode support. Add your pet's photo for a personal touch.

**📱 Multi-Pet Support**
Managing diabetes for more than one pet? No problem — PawCare handles multiple pets, each with their own dashboard, logs, schedules, and vet info.
