Track your pet's insulin, medication, feeding, weight & vet info — all in one app.

### Full Description

**Pawse** is the all-in-one companion app for pet owners managing their pet's health and wellness. Whether your furry friend needs insulin, daily medication, or just consistent feeding and weight tracking, Pawse helps you stay on top of every dose, every meal, and every weigh-in.

**🐾 Everything You Need in One Place**

Managing a pet's health can feel overwhelming — but it doesn't have to be. Pawse gives you a beautiful, intuitive dashboard for each pet, with at-a-glance status on their last insulin dose, most recent feeding, current weight trend, and a countdown timer to their next scheduled care.

**💉 Insulin Tracking**
Log every shot with dose, injection site, time, and notes. Use Quick Log to record a dose at your prescribed amount with a single tap. Pawse supports all common veterinary insulin types including Vetsulin, ProZinc, NPH (Humulin N), and Glargine (Lantus), in both U-40 and U-100 concentrations.

**💊 Medication Schedules**
Track any medication your pet takes — add free-form labels like "Pred 5mg" or "Gabapentin 50mg", set specific times, and get daily reminders. Perfect for pets on multiple medications alongside insulin.

**🍽️ Feeding Log**
Track what your pet eats, how much, and when. Log wet food, dry food, and treats with customizable amounts and units. Consistent feeding is critical for your pet's health — Pawse helps you stay on schedule.

**⚖️ Weight Monitoring**
Regular weigh-ins help you and your vet assess treatment effectiveness. Pawse charts your pet's weight trend over time with a beautiful interactive graph, making it easy to spot changes.

**⏰ Smart Reminders**
Set up recurring schedules for insulin injections, meals, medications, and more. Get push notifications so you never miss a dose — even during a busy day.

**🏥 Vet Info at Your Fingertips**
Store your veterinarian's contact details, emergency number, and clinic address right in the app. One-tap calling for both regular and emergency lines. Plus, built-in pro tips on injection technique, hypoglycemia signs, feeding timing, and insulin storage.

**👨‍👩‍👧 Share with Family & Pet Sitters**
Generate a simple 6-character share code and hand it to a family member, partner, or pet sitter. They can import your pet's profile and log entries too — everyone stays in sync.

**🎨 Beautiful & Customizable**
Choose from 5 gorgeous color themes (Warm, Ocean, Forest, Berry, Midnight), with full light and dark mode support. Add your pet's photo for a personal touch.

**📱 Multi-Pet Support**
Managing health for more than one pet? No problem — Pawse handles multiple pets, each with their own dashboard, logs, schedules, and vet info.
